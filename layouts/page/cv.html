                    <p>My work here covered a wide variety of roles.

Eventually I moved on to join the rest of the small web team in building recruitment systems for clients for the processing of job applications and CVs and their hosting requirements. Through SMRS, I’ve done work for clients such as Sky, Next, Chubb Security, HDNL and Skipton Building Society. Aside from the Admin sections of the websites, I didn’t often get involved in the design side of the websites, and instead focused on building the layout into a framework to implement forms, databases, front-end interactivity and other dynamic aspects. I took Photoshop page designs and built them from scratch, using progressive enhancement to cater for the less capable browsers. My systems were typically built in Ruby on Rails, PHP and MySQL, HTML, CSS1-3 and JQuery. The larger projects were versioned using SVN on Beanstalk, or locally using Git.</p>
